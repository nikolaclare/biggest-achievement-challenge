              The Journey Begins
            </h3>
            <p>
              Cycling has always been a passion, but last year I decided to push myself further. The Great Victorian
              Rail Trail was my longest ride, covering over 240 km across four days...
            </p>
            <p>Riding along the Great Victorian Rail Trail was not just about cycling; it was an immersive experience
              filled with
              natural beauty, cultural landmarks, and community spirit. Each section offered unique sights and
              challenges that made
              every day memorable.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title text-success">Day 1: Tallarook to Molesworth - 55km</h5>
                  <p>The adventure began in Tallarook, a charming town steeped in history and surrounded by scenic
                    landscapes. With
                    excitement and anticipation, I set off on the first leg of my solo cycling journey, covering
                    approximately 55 kilometers
                    through the stunning Trawool Valley.</p>
                  <p>The ride was relatively smooth, thanks to the mostly flat terrain, which provided a comfortable
                    introduction to the
                    trail. As I pedaled, the picturesque countryside unfolded before me—rolling hills, lush greenery,
                    and the serene
                    Goulburn River winding alongside much of the path. The peaceful sounds of nature and the sight of
                    towering trees made
                    the experience feel immersive and tranquil.</p>
                  <p>One of the highlights of the day was passing through the Cheviot Tunnel, the longest rail trail
                    tunnel in Victoria. This
                    historic structure, hidden among dense forest, was both an awe-inspiring sight and a welcome break
                    from the midday sun.</p>
                  <p>After a full day of riding, I arrived in Molesworth, a quiet and almost deserted stopover. With
                    nothing open and no one
                    in sight, I was grateful for the simple yet life-saving provision left at the accommodation—bread
                    and Vegemite. It was a
                    quirky end to the day, but it added to the adventure, making the first night all the more memorable.

                  <p>A long stretch with some challenging climbs and beautiful views along the way...</p>
                  <p>On the second day, I set off from Molesworth towards Mansfield, covering about 66 kilometers. This
                    segment offered a mix
                    of gentle inclines and declines, providing a bit more challenge than the previous day. The landscape
                    transitioned from
                    lush farmland to more rugged terrain as I approached Mansfield.</p>
                  <p>Along the way, I encountered various art installations that celebrated local culture and history,
                    enhancing the ride's
                    aesthetic appeal. The trail also featured several water crossings, allowing for refreshing breaks.
                    Upon reaching
                    Mansfield, I book myself in for a well-earned massage and enjoyed a hearty meal at the local pub.

                  <p>The ride from Mansfield back to Yea was approximately 83 kilometers long. This route was
                    particularly memorable due to
                    its breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. This day was marked by an
                    exhilarating downhill stretch that made all the effort worthwhile.</p>
                  <p>Encountered an unexpected detour due to a farmer blocking the trail to Alexandra. As dusk was
                    approaching had to back
                    track and head to Yea for the night which added kilometres to an already long ride.</p>

                  <p>The final stretch...</p>
                  <p>he final leg of my journey took me back to Tallarook from Yea, covering around 38 kilometers once
                    more. This section
                    felt familiar yet fresh as I appreciated the landscape anew. The ride was mostly flat but included
                    some gentle gradients
                    that kept things interesting.</p>
                  <p>As I retraced my path, I made sure to stop at some favorite spots along the way, including scenic
                    overlooks and local
                    landmarks that had caught my eye previously. Completing this loop felt rewarding, bringing my
                    adventure full circle back
                    to where it all began.
