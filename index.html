              The Journey Begins
            </h3>
            <p>
              Cycling has always been a passion, but last year I decided to push myself further. The Great Victorian
              Rail Trail was my longest ride, covering over 240 km across four days...
            </p>
            <p>Riding along the Great Victorian Rail Trail was not just about cycling; it was an immersive experience filled with
            natural beauty, cultural landmarks, and community spirit. Each section offered unique sights and challenges that made
            every day memorable.</p>

                  <p>The excitement of starting the journey and pushing through the first day of gravel and trails...</p>
                  <p>The adventure began in Tallarook, a quaint town known for its rich history and scenic landscapes. The first leg of the
                  journey, approximately 55 kilometers, led through the picturesque Trawool Valley. This section was relatively flat,
                  making it a comfortable ride for the start of the trip.</p>
                  <p>As I pedaled along, I was greeted by stunning views of rolling hills and the meandering Goulburn River, which
                  accompanied us for much of the ride. A highlight was passing through the Cheviot Tunnel, Victoria's longest rail trail
                  tunnel. The day ended in Molesworth, where nothing was open and no one
                  was to been seen. Luckily the accommodation had left out some slices of bread and vegemite, otherwise I might not have made it through the night!

                  <p>A long stretch with some challenging climbs and beautiful views along the way...</p>
                  <p>On the second day, I set off from Molesworth towards Mansfield, covering about 66 kilometers. This segment offered a mix
                  of gentle inclines and declines, providing a bit more challenge than the previous day. The landscape transitioned from
                  lush farmland to more rugged terrain as I approached Mansfield.</p>
                  <p>Along the way, I encountered various art installations that celebrated local culture and history, enhancing the ride's
                  aesthetic appeal. The trail also featured several water crossings, allowing for refreshing breaks. Upon reaching
                  Mansfield, I book myself in for a well-earned massage and enjoyed a hearty meal at the local pub.</p>

                  <p>The ride from Mansfield back to Yea was approximately 83 kilometers long. This route was particularly memorable due to
                  its breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. This day was marked by an exhilarating downhill stretch that made all the effort worthwhile.</p>
                  <p>Encountered an unexpected detour due to a farmer blocking the trail to Alexandra. As dusk was approaching had to back
                  track and head to Yea for the night which added kilometres to an already long ride.</p>

                  <p>he final leg of my journey took me back to Tallarook from Yea, covering around 38 kilometers once more. This section
                  felt familiar yet fresh as I appreciated the landscape anew. The ride was mostly flat but included some gentle gradients
                  that kept things interesting.</p>
                  <p>As I retraced my path, I made sure to stop at some favorite spots along the way, including scenic overlooks and local
                  landmarks that had caught my eye previously. Completing this loop felt rewarding, bringing my adventure full circle back
                  to where it all began.
